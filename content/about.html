<p>I’m the Research Director for Employee Insurance at Minnesota Management and Budget, where we operate health insurance and related benefits for over 50,000 state employees in Minnesota. My professional interests are in the intersection of health policy, health care financing, and how data can lead to more effective decision making processes to improve health.</p>
<p>On this site, I share some side projects where I apply my own data learnings to interesting questions in health care, sports, the outdoors, or whatever strikes my fancy. Opinions shared here reflect my own views and not those of my employer.</p>
