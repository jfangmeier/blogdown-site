      <description>Bar Chart RacesThe project is inspired by the Athletic’s fantastic series by Matt Brown and Michael Weinreb which looks back on 150 years of college football by summarizing each decade. One of my favorite parts of the series is how it describes the rise and fall of various schools over time, such as the early dominance of the Ivy League prior to World War I, Oklahoma in the 1950s, and Miami in the 1980s.</description>

      <description>I’m the Research Director for Employee Insurance at Minnesota Management and Budget, where we operate health insurance and related benefits for over 50,000 state employees in Minnesota. My professional interests are in the intersection of health policy, health care financing, and how data can lead to more effective decision making processes to improve health.
On this site, I share some side projects where I apply my own data learnings to interesting questions in health care, sports, the outdoors, or whatever strikes my fancy.</description>

      <description>The ChallengeThis weekend, I attempted to solve my first FiveThirtyEight Riddler challenge. Many of these challenges require a bit more probability theory than I’m comfortable with, but this week’s classic challenge hit a subject that I care too much about: college basketball national champions and the bragging rights that come from beating the champ:
On Sunday, the Baylor Lady Bears won the 2019 NCAA women’s basketball championship, and on Monday, the Virginia Cavaliers did the same on the men’s side.</description>
