<h2>Bar Chart Races</h2>
<p>This project is inspired by the Athletic’s fantastic <a href="https://theathletic.com/tag/150-years-of-college-football/">series</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/MattBrownCFB">Matt Brown</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelWeinreb">Michael Weinreb</a> that looks back on 150 years of college football by summarizing each decade. One of my favorite parts of the series is how it describes the rise and fall of various schools over time, such as the early dominance of the Ivy League prior to World War I, Oklahoma in the 1950s, and Miami in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The series also got me to think about how all these trends in program success could be visualized, and a bar chart race seemed like the obvious option to try out. I heard about bar chart races from <a href="https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch">John Burn-Murdoch</a>’s interview on the <a href="https://policyviz.com/podcast/episode-155-john-burn-murdoch/">PolicyViz podcast</a> where he discussed his innovative <a href="https://observablehq.com/@johnburnmurdoch/bar-chart-race-the-most-populous-cities-in-the-world">bar chart race</a> of city populations dating back to 1500 CE. Burn-Murdoch’s chart was created in D3, but I’ve been looking to get some experience with the <code>gganimate</code> R package.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-source-and-wrangling" class="section level2">
<h2>Data source and wrangling</h2>
<p>In order to show win totals for college football programs over time, I needed team record data for all teams for more than a century. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/">Sports Reference</a> kindly provides detailed data on each season for all teams that played major college football. I patiently scraped the win-loss records of each college football program from their <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/">team pages</a>.</p>
<p>A quick note on “major schools:” Sports Reference has a somewhat subjective <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/about/what-is-major.html">definition</a> of major schools that they adopted from <a href="http://www.jhowell.net/cf/scores/ScoresIndex.htm">James Howell</a> that looks at whether a school played 50% or more of its games against football bowl subdivision (FBS) level opponents during a season. Some schools gain or lose major status over time. For example, Yale hasn’t been a major school in football since 1981 by this definition, even though they still play football today. For this project, I only included seasons of major schools.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s load the R packages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(zoo)
library(RcppRoll)
library(gganimate)
library(shadowtext)</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s look at the variables in the data from Sports Reference.</p>

<p>The primary variables I used for this project are <code>school</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>conf</code> (conference membership), <code>w</code> (wins), <code>l</code> (losses), and <code>notes</code>. Within the notes variable is information about whether the school had its record adjusted by the NCAA. For example, USC had to forgo all 12 of its wins from the 2005 season. To line up with the official NCAA records, I parsed the notes field and adjusted team record data accordingly.</p>
<p>Some schools had gaps in their data for when they did not play as a major school or didn’t play at all, so I used <code>tidyr::complete</code> and <code>zoo::na.locf</code> to fill in those years with records of 0 wins and 0 losses.</p>
<p>Finally, I used <code>RcppRoll::roll_sumr</code> to generate 10-year rolling win and loss totals, along with cumulative win and loss totals.</p>

<p>In the last step of data preparation, I ranked each school on their rolling 10-year and cumulative totals for wins and losses. Since I am only going to show the “race” among the leaders for each year, I chose to keep only the top 10 schools for each measure. I also trimmed Washington &amp; Jefferson’s name down a bit.

<h2>Setting up the animation theme</h2>
<p>To make the graphic look a little bit like a football field, I set the background to be “Astroturf Green” and much of the text and lines to be white. Emily Kuehler’s <a href="https://emilykuehler.github.io/bar-chart-race/">post</a> was a huge help with setting up a theme and getting <code>gganimate</code> to work properly.

<p>There is a lot of noise from year to year among the top 10 by rolling win total (as you would expect!), but the plot really does show the rise of certain programs (Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Miami, Alabama). Also, it’s fascinating to see the variation over time in win totals necessary to be at the top.</p>
<p>I’m also pleased with how the conference membership is displayed and how it clearly shows when a school changes conferences, like when Nebraska moved from the Big 8 to the Big 12 in 1990s.</p>

<p>To wrap this up, I also generated a plot of cumulative wins. This plot clearly shows how much of a lead the Ivy League developed from their early start and how they all dropped out of the top 10 once they stopped playing major football in 1981.</p>
